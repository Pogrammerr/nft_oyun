              <h2>Apartments</h2>
              <p>Apartments are ERC721 NFTs that can be minted for 1 AVAX. Apartments produce 1 $RENT per minute when staked. Certainly, it can be increased with better strategies and upgrades. </p>
              <p>Apartments have electricity. Electricity decreases when apartments are staked. In order to continue production, the apartments whose electricity is out need to be refilled by the players using $RENT.</p>
              <p>Since the apartments are ERC721 NFTs, they can be listed on popular secondary markets such as NFTrade.</p>

              <p>Residences are ERC721 NFTs. There are 500 residences in Gen0 and 500 in Gen1. The electricity of the residences is unlimited. Residences produce 2 $RENT per minute. Residences do not have any electricity costs. They produce without any expense. There is a 5% chance to get a residence while minting. </p>
              <p>Residences do not spend slots when staked. For example, although you have a total of 15 slots, you can stake 15 apartments and a residence at the same time. </p>

              <h2>Mint</h2>
              <p>Mint process will start publicly. There is no presale or whitelist option available. Because we don't want the whitelist right to be sold on the black market and the NFTs minted at a cheaper price on the whitelist to be listed below the mint price as soon as the secondary markets are opened. That's why we'll only have one mint day, fair and open to all.</p>
              <p>There will be 2 different mint phases, Gen0 and Gen1. You can own apartments or residences by minting with AVAX in Gen0 or $RENT in Gen1 and produce $RENT by staking them. Gen0 and Gen1 each have 10.000 stocks and there are 20.000 NFTs in total. There are 1,000 residences in total, with 500 in Gen0 and 500 in Gen1.</p>

              <p>The Gen0 minting revenue will be split the following way:</p> 
              <ul>
                <li>25% for the locked liquidity pair $RENT-AVAX.</li>

              <h2>Refund</h2>
              <p>You will also have a refund option while Gen0 sales are open. Everbody who minted at least 3 can use it. This system works as follows:</p>              
              <p>If you give up the NFTs you minted while Gen0 sales are open, you can refund the minted NFTs at the same price. The paperhands can list lower than floor price as soon as the secondary markets open. This is why we provide this opportunity to leave without damaging the project for those who have lost faith in the project. Also, refunded NFTs will airdrop to holders. The more NFTs you have in your wallet, the higher your chances of winning.</p>

              <h2>$RENT</h2>
              <p>$RENT is an ERC20 token produced by apartments and residences. It can be use to mint NFTs from Gen1. $RENT can be cashed out via Trader Joe. In order to earn $RENT, you have to mint or buy apartments or residences and stake them.</p>
              <p>All houses produce $RENTs forever, which means $RENT does not have a maximum supply. However, all $RENTs spent in the Rentstakers game are burned. At the same time, $RENT is tied to the $INVST token. The $INVST token is also a deflationary coin that maintains the worth of the $RENT.</p>
              <p>25% of the Gen0 minting revenue will be used to add locked liquidity on the $RENT-AVAX pair. So this currency can be traded right away as the game starts. The initial price of $RENT will be 0.01$.</p>

              <h2>$INVST</h2>
              <p>$INVST is an ERC20 token. $INVST is a deflationary token that complements the $RENT token. This token is indispensable to ensure the continuity of earnings in the cycle of the game. </p>
              <p>The team does not receive a share of any tokens. All shares are supplied to the players. All $INVST spent on in-game enhancements is burned. Thus, the burned $INVSTs maintain the economy of the game.</p>
              <p>The total supply of $INVST is 16,000,000 divided as follows:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>$100,000 $INVST for $INVST-RENT initial liquidity</li>
                <li>15.900.000 for Investment pool rewards</li>
                <li>The starting price for $INVST will be 200 $RENT.</li>

              <h2>Staking</h2>
              <p>You need to stake for your houses to produce $RENT.  Initially each wallet has a maximum of 20 stake slots. Staked apartments spend one slot. Staked apartments earn 1 $RENT per minute. While the apartments are in stake, the amount of electricity in their capacity decreases with each passing second. The electricity of the apartments lasts for about 12 hours. If they are not refilled when their electricity runs out, they become unable to produce $RENT.</p>
              <p>Residences produce 2 $RENT per minute when staked. Residences do not have electricity costs. They can produce unlimited and non-stop. Staked residences do not spend any slots.</p>

              <p>When you claim $RENT tokens that came from staked houses, 15% comes to the bank as property tax, 15% is burned. When you want to withdraw these $RENTs accumulated in the bank, there are 3 different options:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Receive all of them by waiting 3 days.</li>
                <li>Withdrawing by waiting 1 day. (15% stays in the bank, 15% burns)</li>
                <li>Withdrawing immediately. (25% stays in bank, 25% burns) </li>

              <h2>Investment Pool</h2>
              <p>To earn $INVST, you need to create a liquidity pair $RENT-AVAX via traderjoe. You can earn $INVST by staking LP tokens here. The more LP tokens you stake, the more $INVST you can earn.</p>
              <p>In this way, $RENT gains value in $RENT-AVAX parity and the income you get from the houses you stake increases. Every $INVST spent on upgrade items, extra slots, and similar enhancements is burned. Thanks to this cycle, the continuity of the game's economy allows you to earn a long-term passive income. </p>
